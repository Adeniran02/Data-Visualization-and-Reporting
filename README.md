# Data-Visualization-and-Reporting

Hello Friends, 
I recently completed a final project for my Data Architecture course. The project focused on utilizing Power BI for data transformation, analytics, and visualization. With my previous experience using this tool to uncover insights in my earlier career, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project.

This particular course 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 placed me on top of my toes in the last three (3) weeks as I got introduced in-depth to these topics; Data Analytics in Azure (Azure architecture and services, Azure management and governance), Intro to Power BI, Excel for Data, On-Prem Data SSIS, On-Prem Data SSAS and lastly Data Architectures and Design.

I explored the data on International Students in Canada (Part 1) from Kaggle, intending to gain insights and revelations into this vibrant community that I am part of in Canada 🙂.
